# ![TechidonLogo](mastodon/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher_round.png) Techidon, modified mastodon client!


> A fast, highly customizable, up-to-date fork of [moshidon](https://github.com/LucasGGamerM/moshidon), which seemed to be abandoned at the time of forking. It fixes a stopping timeline bug and refactored deprecated API to the current Android API. It also has ongoing security and accessibility improvements.

## Key Features

### Flexible Timelines

Under the Home menu by default you can see your active account's timeline, your server's local timeline, and your server's federated timeline. You can also pin hashtags, lists, other servers, or make a custom view of just your posts, your bookmarks, or your favourites for quick access. Then sort these timelines to prioritize the ones you visit most often.

### Multiple Accounts & Crossposting

Sign in to multiple accounts in the same app and easily switch between them. Press and hold on the boost or fave button to boost or fave a post to a different account than the one you are currently browsing with. 

### Drafts & Scheduled Posts

Write posts and save them, or schedule them to post later. Edit and delete your drafts.

### Alt Text Tag & Reminder

An unobtrusive ALT tag appears on images with alt text. Clicking on the icon makes the alt text appear. By default, Techidon will show a warning to add alt text if your post has any attachments lacking alt text. This is for better accessibility, and it can be disabled in settings. You can also hide from your feed all posts that are lacking in alt text.

### Themes & Customization

Techidon is designed according to Material Design principles. Follow your device's light or dark mode settings or change colour palette - your system's default, purple, black & white, "pitch black" (battery saving) and more. Customize your experience by moving or renaming the publish button, show or hide sensitive media by default, reduce motion, collapse long posts, add haptic feedback, or making the fave button a heart &hearts; or a star &starf;.

### Not Just For Mastodon

Supports features available on other types of fediverse servers such as admin announcements, showing pronouns in user names, post translation, emoji reactions, local-only posting, and markdown or html in posts.

### Fully Federated Feed & Profiles

See all public posts from servers your server federates with and fetch profiles from a user's local server for accurate up to date information.
